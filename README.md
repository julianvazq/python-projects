# python-web-crawler
A simple web crawler written in Python using the BeautifulSoup module that retrieves information from a science-basd nutrition website (examine.com) and sends me an email containing a brief summary and URL of trending articles on a weekly basis.

NO LONGER WORKS DUE TO WEBSITE REDISNG. 

TO DO: find new science-based nutrition site and rewrite script.
